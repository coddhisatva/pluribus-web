			<h1 class="display-sm">The plan to improve Pluribus through 2023</h1>

			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">September 2022</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Public Release of MVP</h3>
			<p>
				This prototype is meant to act as a demonstration for creators like yourself and we&rsquo;d like to integrate their
				feedback to tighten things up before adding functionality for supporters. Once that&rsquo;s complete, we&rsquo;ll be
				ready to go live with the features you&rsquo;ve seen previewed here as well as option to pay in crypto, which will
				expand alongside the remainder of the updates listed below.
			</p>
			
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">Autumn 2022</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Responsive Crowdfunding</h3>
			<p>
				The most sensible improvement is also one of the easiest: implement responsive crowdfunding (i.e. conventional,
				“GoFundMe”-type crowdfunding) that is automatically triggered when you execute your policy to bolster the protection
				provided by the standard proactive crowdfunding. When the alert goes out to supporters that have pledged, they can
				then post a link to the wider public to make the rest of the Internet aware they can donate.
			</p>
			
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">Winter 2023</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Mutual Aid Funding</h3>
			<p>
				Creators are the first ones that can take advantage of this because they already have audiences that can generate
				a decent amount of protection, but most people don&rsquo;t have that luxury. After some time to grow the user base,
				we&rsquo;ll roll out the ability for “average” users (or even just smaller creators) to collect pledges and pool them
				together to generate protection they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to otherwise. There&rsquo;s only one additional step needed,
				otherwise it will function the same as the proactive funding displayed here.
			</p>
				
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">Winter &ndash; Spring 2023</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Mass Shaming Alerts</h3>
			<p>
				Not to be confused with the alert that goes out for your policy execution (and eventual responsive campaign launch),
				this is to rapidly mobilize crowdsourced support as a live response to a social media attack. The only proper response
				to a networked attack, is a networked defense. Available to all users. 
			</p>
				
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">Spring &ndash; Summer 2023</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Professional Directories of Relevant Services</h3>
			<p>
				It will take a few months to grow the user base enough to attract these businesses first, but once we do, there are
				obvious incentives for services that can help you to advertise on the platform. Whether its PR firms, mental health
				services, reputation management consulants, recruiters/headhunters, or simply businesses that would like to team up with
				figures with overlapping customer bases- anything that might be in demand among potentially Cancelled people will be
				fair game (heck, let us know any you&rsquo;d like so we can strike up some relationships).
			</p>
				
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">Summer 2023</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Quadratic Funding (i.e. Centralized Matching Pools)</h3>
			<p>
				While there are millions of people willing to contribute to people on an individual basis, the simple fact is most normies
				don&rsquo;t follow things close enough to do so- however, the vast majority of them still hate Cancel Culture with a
				passion. For these folks, they can contribute a small amount of money each month that will go to Centralized Matching Pools
				to amplify the effect of the types of funding we&rsquo;ve talked about already. You can almost think of it like how people
				donate to charities they care about if properly communicated, we estimate the market willing to make contribution to an
				Anti-Cancel Culture Fund to be in the tens of millions. The mathematics behind Quadratic Funding can be quite complicated,
				but you can learn more on Vitalik Buterin&rsquo;s blog here.
			</p>
			
			<h5 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-0">End of 2023</h5>
			<h3 class="display-xxs">Retroactive Public Goods Funding</h3>
			<p class="mb-5">
				This requires the most amount of money to work well, but we are very excited about it. Once the central funding pools
				mentioned above reach a certain size, we will devote a portion of the fund to be distributed periodically
				(ultimately every month) according to a vote for who as best exemplified the ethos of the platform in that timeframe.
				This is not winner-take-all, and will be conducted via Quadratic Voting, where each person can allocate a % of their
				vote to multiple recipients to reflect their degree of preference and mitigate simple popularity contests. As the pool
				of available funds becomes more plentiful, this will include additional categories to reward over time.
