				In the event the worst should come to pass, this is where you activate your policy to convert the pledges you have accumulated into active donations to be transferred to your account. Everyone that has contributed toward your pledge pool will be notified that you have elected to do so. As per our policy, the default assumption is that your claim is legitimate, and the pledged funds will be transferred to your account in 7 days pending confirmation the majority of your donors do not disapprove of this action. While approving your claim is the baseline result, they are given the option to vote “Thumbs Down” and if more than 50% feel your rationale falls outside of the parameters they agreed to payout for, your claim will be placed on hold pending a 2nd vote. (see “How it Works” for more).

				With this in mind, we encourage you to reassess whether the circumstances that triggered your decision to activate this policy does in fact meet the previously specified criteria and that your supporters will agree. Now, kindly articulate to your supporters why you are electing to activate your policy at this time below:

Hello,

_____ has elected to execute the policy you have contributed to on the following grounds: [Creator Claim Here]

As per our policy, these transactions are approved by default barring substantial backlash from those who have pledged. 

Does this meet the criteria you agreed to when you donated? If not and you feel this transaction violates the agreement, please explain below. If more than half of your fellow donors agree with you, the claim will be placed on hold until an internal review is completed.

Please note: The only way we can provide creators with the security we all want them to have is by cultivating an atmosphere of trust, and this is not the time to dwell on trivialities. If you vote “no”, it must be due to a clear cut case of your trust having been violated, and will only have an effect if the majority of your fellow supporters are in agreement with you.
