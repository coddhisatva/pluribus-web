                        <p>This is new, so this mistake is understandable, but Pluribus doesn’t compete with these services, it compliments them.</p>
                        <p>The recurring payments model of the majority of “creator economy” revenue streams (including the two mentioned above) is inherently restricted to a high-interest, low-volume audience. Users can only spend $5/mo on so many people, so a certain portion of a creators audience that would otherwise pay for more content falls just shy of the interest or budget threshold necessary to join a given creators income stream. However, the option to make a one-time pledge to a creator for an unspecified time in the future that may not even occur allows for much greater flexibility. By introducing this option, Pluribus increases the percentage of a creator’s audience that can be monetized without being extractive.</p>

                        <p>We’ve known the clock will be ticking for mainstream service providers from day one, which is why we’ve spent hundreds of hours preparing multiple layers of backup options for each chokepoint that powerful forces can exert pressure on, including “un-cancellable” tech that has not yet matured but we are keeping our eye on to make the switch when that becomes possible. We’ve learned from the experiences of other companies and fully understand that being able to survive coordinated attacks is mandatory- so we will. </p>

                        <p>Pluribus is of course a nod to the US Motto of E pluribus unum or "Out of Many, One”. However, by itself it means “More”. More as in there are more people that want to hear people’s opinions and see their talents flourish than those who wish to silence or damage them. A severely unwell and numerically tiny amount of people has managed to run rings around the rest of the population via their control of institutions and the tools those institutions provide. Luckily, new institutions and tools are coming to the fore. This is one of them. There are more of us and it is time to start acting like it.</p>

                            After a creator executes their policy, donors have seven days to object if they feel the claim falls outside the mutually agreed upon parameters or is otherwise perceived to be illegitimate (such as deliberately triggering consequences just to receive a payout). If less than 50% of donors formally object to the claim within a week, the claim is approved and the funds are officially transferred.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The assumption of legitimacy as a baseline as opposed to putting every claim up to a vote is to ensure the security (both financial and psychological) of the recipients. For anyone to object, they must go out of their way to express it- which they will if they feel they’ve been taken advantage of. Otherwise, there are few reasons why either side would find themselves at odds with the other.

                        <p>Welcome to Pluribus, where you can proactively crowdfund a safety net to hedge against a potential cancellation. The ability to tailor your protection according to your personal situation is extremely important to us, but for the sake of clarity, here are the basic standards of what qualifies as legitimate scenarios to collect pledges for:</p>

                        <p>Scenarios wherein the pledge recipient experiences an event that directly removes (not reduces) access to a channel that provides income directly (i.e. Patreon, salaried job, etc.) or indirectly (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.) via the audience it provides. This means that temporary suspensions from platforms, delays on projects, or other similarly unfortunate yet less severe situations do not currently meet the necessary threshold (this will eventually change in time, but for now, we’re keeping it simple).</p>

                        <p>Aside from this basic distinction, we will not be placing limits on how you articulate the criteria you would like protection from. However, please be advised that it is ultimately up to your supporters whether your terms are deemed to be agreeable- even allies will hardly be inclined to provide a lifeline that can be tapped from a mild inconvenience. In addition, should you decide to execute your policy, they will use their discretion to determine if your claim falls within the parameters you are about to set.</p>

                        <p>These are the minimal necessary conditions to deter bad actors. That said, if you are a good actor (and we’re sure that you are!), then you have nothing to worry about. You know your relationship with your supporters better than we do, which is why we’ve left the rest up to you. Now- what scenario(s) would you like to protect yourself against?  </p>

                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“I’d like protection in case I get de-platformed from Patreon”</li>
                            <li>“I make my living on the road so I’d like any pledges to kick in if any venues cancel my appearances from outside pressure in the future”</li>
                            <li>“I’m on two Youtube strikes, I need this in case I get a 3rd”</li>
                            <li>“I rely on two major sponsorships, I’d like security in case one of them is successfully pressured to cut ties with me before my contract expires”</li>
                        </ul>
